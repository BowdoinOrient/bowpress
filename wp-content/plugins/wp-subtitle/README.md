WP Subtitle
===========

Add subtitles (subheadings) to your pages, posts or custom post types.

The WP Subtitle plugin allows your pages and posts to contain a subtitle.  Also called a sub-heading, this this short line of text is meant to appear beneath a post's (or page's) title, but can be inserted in your template wherever you choose.

`<?php the_subtitle(); ?>` is used for inside The Loop. If you wish to get a page/post's subtitle outside The Loop, use `<?php get_the_subtitle( $post ); ?>`, where $post is a post object or ID ($post->ID).

### Parameters

Just like WP's built-in `<?php the_title(); ?>` method, `<?php the_subtitle(); ?>` tag accepts three parameters:

**$before**  
*(string)* Text to place before the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$after**  
*(string)* Text to place after the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$echo**  
*(boolean)* If true, display the subtitle in HTML. If false, return the subtitle for use in PHP. Defaults to true.

Things are slightly different in `<?php get_the_subtitle(); ?>`:

**$post**  
*(int|object)* Post, page or custom post type object or ID.

**$before**  
*(string)* Text to place before the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$after**  
*(string)* Text to place after the subtitle. Defaults to "".

**$echo**  
*(boolean)* If true, display the subtitle in HTML. If false, return the subtitle for use in PHP. Defaults to true.

For full details on the template tags and their arguments, [view the documentation here](https://github.com/benhuson/wp-subtitle/wiki).

By default, subtitle are supported by both posts and pages. To add support for custom post types use add_post_type_support( 'my_post_type', 'wps_subtitle' ).
