== Description ==

A fork of the incredible Art Direction plugin by No‘l Jackson (http://noel.io).  Utilizes `wp_head` instead of `ob_start()` for styles to insure they remain intact during a cached environment.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `better-art-direction` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the Art Direction menu under the post entry text
