= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full "domain mapping", subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for social sites and search engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their page settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to reduce automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.3 and higher.
* WordPress 4.4 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* Multisite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is greatly appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works. =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
It contains extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments". The plugin or theme author should know that that means.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as "Structured Data".

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available.
The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Categories, Tags and other terms' SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 3.0.6 - Lionize =

**Release date**

* May 6th, 2018

**Summarized:**

* TSF now integrates completely with attachment pages.
* Non-personalized Facebook profile links can now be set via the Social SEO settings and user's Authorial Info settings.
* Seven bugs have been fixed, mainly involving descriptions and the sitemap.
* The plugin now suggests, **once**, that you can use Focus keywords via the Extension Manager.

**For everyone, about the suggestion:**

* We believe not everyone is up-to-date yet with the current progression of the extensions. Some of which can help you out greatly with SEO.
* So, from this update, all sites will get a one-time-only auto-dismissing suggestion for [TSFEM](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
* This suggestion has many conditions attached before being shown. So, it's likely you won't ever see it.
* We understand that not everyone welcomes this introduction. However, this suggestion is to help this plugin and your site grow, from which we all will benefit.

**For developers, about descriptions:**

* If you're using description-related filters or functions from TSF on your sites, check out the detailed "for developers" log.
* Many functions have been silently deprecated, and you should now use simple caller functions.
* No action is needed from your side until the next major release (ETA July 2018).

**For developers, about titles ETA July 2018:**

* In the next major release, we're going to change how we handle titles.
* This change won't affect users directly. But it will allow us to manipulate the titles better.
* For more information, [view and subscribe to issue 202](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/202).

[View the detailed log](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2365#detailed).

= 3.0.5 - Rectified =

**Release date:**

* February 27th, 2018

**Summarized:**

* An issue with outdated browsers not parsing TSF's admin JavaScript has been resolved.

[View the detailed log](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2272#detailed).

= 3.0.4 - Illustrious =

**Release date:**

* February 25th, 2018

**Did you know?**

* We're working on an extension for keyword and subject analysis, named [Focus](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/tree/master/extensions/free/focus/trunk).
* In its current state, it's already on par with other solutions, but we are going to take it even further.
* More details will follow in a blog post, which we'll link to on our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/TheSEOFramework) when the features are ready.

**Summarized:**

* This is a maintenance release with over 10 bugs fixed. Most notoriously were pixel guideline calculation errors and home page title errors.
* Open Graph and Twitter custom title and description options have been added to every post, page, and CPT.
* The description character count and pixel length guidelines have been updated.
* All publicly queryable CPT posts and pages now support SEO settings and are included in the sitemap. No more messing with filters is needed.

**About the new description guidelines:**

* Google increased their SERP's description length a few months ago, so we've updated the upper-limit guidelines.
* We recommend enforcing these new guidelines for new pages, cornerstone pages, and the home page.
* Although the description lengths have been updated, the transient cache isn't invalidated.
* Over time the cache will refresh itself, this is done automatically by WordPress, or via your caching plugin's transients handler (if applicable).

**About the social meta input:**

* There are new Open Graph and Twitter inputs in the SEO Settings.
* The Twitter settings, when left empty, will use the Open Graph output.
* The Open Graph settings, when left empty, will use the SEO meta output.
* As always, auto-generated Open Graph and Twitter descriptions won't use prefixes.

**Found unwanted links in the sitemap?**

* If you find posts in the sitemap that shouldn't be there, please refer to [our renewed FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#faq).
* The FAQ entry title is "The sitemap contains unwanted links".

= 3.0.0 - Eminence =

**Release date:**

* November 19th, 2017

**Did you know?**

* Since about a week ago, 3 new free extensions are available in the [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

**Summarized:**

* Finally, after 8 months of preparation, experimenting, testing, and coding, TSF 3.0 is here.
* This update focuses on improved social site interaction, WordPress' API coherence, and optimizing UX.
* To improve social site interaction, social site links can be added through author profile pages.
* The Open Graph protocol has been updated, so will your meta output.
* The canonical URL generation has been revised, and it now works mostly through WordPress' API.
* For improved UX we've added pixel counters, better tooltips, and admin color scheme adherence.
* Oh, you can also select the primary term for each hierarchical post type.

**New primary terms:**

* *In WordPress, terms are generally known as categories.*
* The primary term influences how canonical URLs are generated for the post, and how breadcrumbs are constructed.
* Next to each term selection list, you'll now see radio buttons pop up aside each selected term.
* The selected term will be assigned as the primary term.
* If no primary term is selected, an assigned term that has been implemented earliest on the site will be used.
* Note that this feature requires JavaScript to be enabled. Authors without JavaScript can't change the primary term.

**Revised canonical URLs:**

* The canonical URL generation has been completely rewritten. Most users won't notice anything from this.
* It now uses WordPress' 4.6+ canonical URL generation (backward-compatibility is provided), instead of an in-house "guessing" version.
* **So, the Canonical URL should now always be compatible with any plugin, out of the box.** This is great news for translation plugin users!
* Note that canonical URLs are no longer outputted on private or unpublished posts.
* Note that if a query isn't registered correctly, the URL will also stay empty. Or, in unlikely cases, it will link to the home page.
	* Contact the respective plugin author on such issues. I'd love to help them correct this.

**Finally, author SEO:**

* On profile pages of users with Author capabilities (or higher), two new settings have been added under heading **"Authorial Info"**.
* Here, authors can set their Facebook profile page and Twitter profile page.
* These links will be used in Open Graph and Twitter meta output.
* Note that the author's profile must be public for it to be used when sharing links.
* When no author links are set, the "new" fallback URLs from the Social Meta Settings will be used.
* Expand your authorial presence using the free [Articles Extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/).

**A better admin experience:**

* This plugin now uses your chosen admin color scheme, subtly. You can see it being used as highlights and for tooltips.
* About tooltips, they've been completely rewritten:
	* They now look for boundaries, so they won't fall off the page or bound box. They can also face down when needed.
	* They try to center themselves based on your initial pointer position.
	* They work perfectly on any touch screen, also using Windows Touch.
	* They no longer gulp down RAM, they use cutlery. Basically, fewer DOM items initiate them and they self-destruct as they disappear.
	* Tooltips are now used on every `[?]` mark, so you can instantly see what those marks convey.
* Title input and preview generation has also been completely rewritten, and this was a big challenge to implement:
	* Titles now update on various actions, like updating the visibility or name of the page.
	* Titles now show prefixes, like "Private:" or "Protected:". They'll try to fit neatly, wherever.
	* Character counters are now always correct; they no longer "guess", they "know".
	* Pixel counters have been added too. More on that below.
* The CSS and JS scripts implemented by TSF have been optimized even further. So your admin experience should be a little speedier.

**The pixel counter:**

* A character-count guideline is nice to have. But it remains a guideline, and you want facts... correct?
* So, we've added a pixel counter. This pixel counter knows exactly how much space your titles and descriptions take up in Google's SERP.
* To explain this difference visually: Five characters of "WWWWW" take up more space than five of "IIIII".
* Hover over the pixel counter to see how many pixels you've used.
* Through testing we found that time-sensitive items (i.e. articles) have less space available for descriptions.
* You can enable and disable the character and pixel counters at the Layout settings.
* Note that new installations won't get to see the character counter by default anymore.
* Note that the pixel counter isn't represented (yet) by the SEO Bar. So, you shouldn't have to worry about yellow or even red items.

**AI good structure:**

* You can now upload a square website logo. This is used in the [Articles Extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/), too.
* The "Site Name" project has been dropped, and this data is now fetched through other means, like the "Sitelinks Searchbox".
* Breadcrumbs have been revised, too. The generation is now smarter in tree selection, and only one breadcrumb is outputted, which uses your primary term selection.
* WooCommerce 3.0+ products are recognized correctly by search engines, once more.

**Privacy everywhere:**

* When you click on any link outputted by TSF on your domain, you can be certain it no longer carries any traceable information.

**A note on browser compatibility:**

* As we want to move forward, we don't believe we should be supporting insecure browsers.
* So, your admin experience will be degraded when using an outdated browser.
* Be sure to use at least IE 11, Safari 10, iOS 10, or better.
* We expect only a few users to be negatively affected. For everyone else, we welcome you to the future of browsing.

**Survey:**

* After updating and playing around with the update, feel free to fill in our [update survey](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1781). Tell us what you like or what could've been done better.
