= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full Domain Mapping, subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for Social Sites and Search Engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their set settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to prevent automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.

* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.3 and higher.
* WordPress 4.4 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins WPML, Polylang and qTranslate X.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website.
It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.
However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= Is there a Premium version? =

Nope! This plugin is all-inclusive.

= Free & Premium Extensions =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

The SEO Framework is its own self-serving technical framework. It keeps track of everything WordPress and SEO while it allows other plugins to interact with it easily.
Through its framework it allows you to SEO your complete website. It also allows for extensions and real-time alterations; for when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone; however, The SEO Framework provides an easier and faster way of doing so.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as Structured Data.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

**Summarized:**

* Social images can now scale up to 4K resolution. This means (manual and automated) forced cropping no longer initiates at 1500px but at 4096px.
* A new option has been added for every taxonomical post type in the Visibility tab. It allows you to prevent the annotated pages from showing up in Archives.
* Structured Data output has been revisited. This includes merging of output, removal of misplaced output, and performance improvements.
* When your home page is a blog, pages without an ID (404, search, date archives, etc.) had output and caching issues. These issues have been resolved.
* Several security concerns have also been addressed. Although, none of them could be verified as the coding environment is already well protected.

**For everyone: Caching changes:**

* Descriptions and Schema.org output transients are no longer enabled by default. Because for most sites, it's better left disabled.
* This has been done to reduce database calls. Ultimately, the performance benefits of using the transients are use-case specific.

**For developers: Schema.org output code changes:**

* The Schema.org output code has been [rewritten](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/97). This improves reliability, performance and extensibility.
* If you've extended or altered the Schema.org generation output, you might wish to revisit your coding implementations.
* All affronted methods have been correctly deprecated and tested once more. So, 500 errors shouldn't occur.
* To be certain, visit the detailed changelog and compare your code.

**For high-traffic webmasters and Google Analytics integration plugin authors: About the Search URL change:**

* From this update, new canonical URLs will be generated for search queries to comply to the pretty permalink structure.
* WordPress natively supports the `/search/{search_term}` endpoint; however, Google Analytics does not.
* To enable support, please visit [this page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en&ref_topic=1031951#Post) for more information.
* I've created a plugin that will enhance support for you. You can download it [here](https://gist.github.com/sybrew/ab5553dd8a06e73794680c4a2cc24661).
* An extension is planned that will implement Google Analytics for you, complying to those guidelines.

* Moreover, various bugs have been fixed, mainly concerning third party plugins.

**We're looking for translation editors:**

* First, thank you so much to all the translation [contributors](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription/contributors).
* Now, if you want to see The SEO Framework in your language, head over to [this page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription) and feel free to contribute.
* If you wish to easily maintain and keep a close eye on all the contributions for your language, [ask us](https://theseoframework.com/contact/) to ask WordPress Polyglots to add you as a contributor.
* Ultimately, it's up to the WordPress Polyglots team to fulfill your request. It generally depends on how well you've submitted translations for you to be accepted.

**A few notes about translations:**

* If you use a machine to translate for you, note that they can generate out-of-context strings. So keep an eye out for those!
* If you notice that strings are very hard to translate, e.g. because of grammatical gender, [let us know](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/new)!
* Please don't translate "The SEO Framework", it's a registered brand-name.
* Be sure not to add spaces if you see backticks, asterisks, or brackets. They're used for Markdown language construction.
* In TSF, you generally can't use UTF character codes like `&#38;#x2661;`, as they're automatically removed or rendered unreadable for added security. Add them as displayed instead: **♡**.

**For everyone: Tabbed In-post SEO layout**

* This release brings tabbed layout to the in-post SEO settings.
* With this change I've also altered the overall looks, with the help from [Daniel](https://github.com/danielpost).
* This layout allows extensions from the [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/) to be implemented much easier.
* This layout is self-responsive! This means it's not dependent on the browser size, but on how much content will fit.
* Therefore, this layout allows the SEO settings to be placed in the right sidebar! Take a look at the [new screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots).

**For everyone: Browser support**

* This release brings [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) to the new in-post SEO settings meta box.
* The flexbox module is still experimental, in a way that not all browsers correctly support this to the fullest extend.
* However, support for as many browsers feasible has been implemented. Check out [the list](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1903#browser-support). Enjoy!
* The gist is that Chrome, Firefox, IE10 and Safari 6 or later are supported.

**SEO Tip of the Update - Trust in layout**

* Is your website glitchy and has placeholder images, unmatched colors or weirdly contrasting borders all over the place?
* Consider going for a more modern and clean layout. Strip out what isn't necessary. A clean layout implies professionalism and increases visitors' trust.
* Even if you're just starting out with your website, remove all that could be but really isn't. Because if you leave in placeholders for the future, it implies amateurism.
* People want their truth to be confirmed or their problems to be solved. If you can't confirm or solve the layout of your website, then they won't trust you to do so for their issues.
* Simply put: It doesn't have to be perfect, it just must be done.

**Detailed log:**

* ***It is some miles, but [it will shorten your journey tomorrow](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1903#detailed).***
