	= 2.3.3 - Domain Age is important =

* Is your domain name just registered? Give it some time. It can take from three to six months before Google thinks you deserve a better spot on the search results page. Google doesn't really like new domains because new domains often contain spam. While waiting for a higher spot, be creative! Get awesome content out there for when your domain does get some authority :).
* Bing and Yahoo, however, don't (really) look at domain age, but rather at domain name. So it's much easier to rank higher early on those search engines. DuckDuckGo is still a mystery but it seems that they look at Geo location, backlinks and titles.

	= 2.3.4 - Descriptions are organic & Limiting scripts =

* Search engines do not always pick out the description you've provided, but sometimes take an organic part based on your search query. This only proves more that your content is more important than SEO optimization. But every little part helps!
* One little part that helps, a lot, is that you reduce the amount of styles and scripts you push to the visitor. Use a great theme from the WordPress repository or use a premium theme from Genesis or WooThemes. They work according to the standards and are following guidelines set by Automattic. Also avoid using many plugins that provide front-end goodies, but only use what you really need. Your visitors and Search Engines alike will love your site for it!

	= 2.3.5 - Go Social & Use Knowledge Graph =

* Go social! Search Engines don't just look at your website anymore these days, but also take a look at social activity. Most importantly: Having a Facebook, Twitter and/or Google+ page increases your chances to be found.
* Use the Knowledge Graph options to improve Search Engine presence on your company or trademark by connecting your site socially, be sure to engage with your audience by linking back to content on your site. But don't spam!

	= 2.3.6 - Plenty of Content, but not too much =

* Make sure you have plenty of content for your visitors to read. About 600 to 1900 words of content per page is recommended.
* Your content is for your visitors, not for search engines.
* So, do not split up content if it exceeds the recommended amount. If a piece of text can't support itself, readers won't understand the subject and will leave your website.
* If you have fewer words but you've covered everything that needed to be covered for the page, don't extend it just for the sake of SEO. Do not over-optimize.

	= 2.3.7 - Sitemaps, just wait and see =

* Nowadays, sitemaps are a tool for Search Engines, not for users. This means that styling the sitemap just adds unnecessary resource usage.
* Having a sitemap available will make sure your content is reached out faster to the Search Index since the Search Engines know what has changed and when. So be sure to enable the lastmod feature if you frequently post new posts or pages!
* No sitemap? Not a problem! Search Engines will just follow links within your site to find new pages. This default behavior will also continue with a sitemap available, so no pages are missed even if your sitemap has reached its limit.

	= 2.3.8 - Title Tag binds your site together, answer questions with it =

* The Title tag is considered the most important part for SEO. It's what binds the whole site together. That's why this plugin outputs the blog name on every page.
* Having a well-constructed Title consists of the Blog Name and an addition. This addition should describe the whole page in a few words.
* Referring back to the Title within the first or last paragraph, or within a subheader as well as in the Description will improve your chances to be found for those words.
* Alternatively, a question as the title where you give an answer in the first paragraph is considered rich content. It might even put your page in the rich content results on Google.

	= 2.3.9 - Following visitors, hook them with an introduction =

* Search engines follow visitor interaction throughout the pages. If a visitor doesn't stay on a page long enough and hits the back button, your content probably isn't what the visitor was looking for and the Search Engine gets notified and adjusts for future queries.
* So be sure to create great titles and build a related and constructive first paragraph. If the visitor is hooked, the visitor will stay, read on or click through. Search Engines take note of this and your SERP value goes up.

	= 2.4.0 - Invalid HTML, Valid Content and use HTML5 =

* Invalid HTML doesn't affect your site's SEO value. However, valid HTML is considered best practice, and with a good reason.
* The good reason for valid HTML is that you can be certain that your website (almost) looks the same on every browser, so you're certain that the visitor will see your website as you intended.
* However, it doesn't affect your site's SEO value because Search Engines want to put out the best content for your search, not the most 'valid' content.
* With so many "invalid" websites out there, Search Engines try to read the HTML as many web browsers would: by fixing common mistakes.
* Still using HTML4 or xHTML? Try to find a way to upgrade to HTML5, its semantic elements are very SEO friendly.

	= 2.4.1 - Navigation and Naming internal links =

* Navigation is very important for your website. Depending on your content, create an easy menu on what visitors need the most.
* Do not depend on your sitemap too much, if a user can't find a page, then why should a Search Engine?
* Internal links with aptly named titles are therefore considered best practice. Naming a link "read more here" is for this reason not advised for links that lead to landing pages.
* Rather use: Read all about "my product name here". Do not forget to make everything natural to read.

	= 2.4.2 - Canonical URLs =

* Canonical URLs are the URLs that lead to exactly where a page is located. It's very important for Search Engines to find the right page, to prevent duplicated content mistakes.
* The Search Engine will therefore always follow the canonical URL and will most likely ignore the current page if the canonical URL points to a page other than the current page.
* For this reason, the canonical URL within The SEO Framework will look for many variables before making one, with this update even more so.
* This concludes that it's advised not to touch the Custom Canonical URL unless you're absolutely certain that Search Engines should look for another webpage.

	= 2.4.3 - Go blog, keep it related =

* Maintaining a blog will output not only fresh content, and notify Search Engines that your website is active, but it will also simultaneously improve your chances to be found.
* There are so many (big) questions to be answered, a blog post on each of those questions will surely attract different visitors.
* Keep the blog related to the main subject of your site, for it will categorize your website as a whole. Visitors will more likely engage and then keep coming back for more information.
* After all, you're most likely the expert on the subject of your website. Share your knowledge!

	= 2.5.0 - Featured Images for Posts =

* Images are a great way to attract visitors. Not only will it make your site more lively, visitors will also know right away what the subject is about or related to.
* Images are also required for Posts to adhere to the article standard set by Google for generating better Rich Snippets to be shown in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP).
* Force yourself and your team to improve the SEO of your site by using the Require Featured Image plugin by David Hayes.

	= 2.5.1 - Speed up the Web =

* Having a faster website will improve your Search Engine Results Page (SERP) ranking.
* It will also prevent potential visitors from hitting the back button if they can't reach your website in a timely manner.
* See SEO Tip of The Update (2.3.9) for related information on how page speed affects SEO.

	= 2.5.2 - Engage on Trends =

* If you are writing blog posts, take a look at the rising trends at Google Trends before it's all over the internet.
* Write about any of the trends once in a while, and if the trend kicks off your website might just be exposed to many people.

	= 2.6.0 - Redirects & Canonical =

* A change in the Canonical URL or the use of a 301 Redirect URL indicates that your page has moved.
* These can be seen by Search Engines as the same. However, the 301 Redirect enforces the relocation of the page to everyone, whereas the Canonical URL softly indicates.
* When changing the Canonical URL of a Page, you're telling robots to look and elsewhere, be sure to include a link to the new Page on the canonicalized Page to indicate where everything has moved to.
* However, it's even better to enforce a 301 redirect. This makes sure both your visitors as Search Engines know where to be instantaneously.
* If you've changed the permalink of a popular post, you should create an empty post that follows one of the said examples.

	= 2.6.1 - Image Descriptions =

* Do you use Images in your Posts and Pages? Be sure to describe them! This way people are able to find your website through the Image Results.
* This can be easily done when editing the Image through WordPress' Media Library or when inserting an Image in the content. When you click on an Image, you can define various details.
* The Alt Text is to be used. If that's not found, the Image Caption is used. And if that's also not found, then the Image Title will be used.
* Make sure it clearly describes the Image, and be aware that it will fall back to it when the browser can't render the Image. It's also a great addition for people who are vision impaired.

	= 2.6.2 - Geo Targeting =

* Is your website about a local business? Then be sure to sign up for Google Businesses. This will massively increase your search presence, by an artificial result.
* It also greatly helps to have your server located near your target audience's location. The website will not only respond faster, but Search Engines can pick up descriptive signals from it.
* If your business resides and only serves in Belgium, for example, it's also better to have a ".be" domain name extension rather than a ".com" domain name extension.

	= 2.6.3 - Keep it Alive =

* Have you written about something already, and is the subject coming up again? Link back to the older publication.
* About 2 to 5 internal links within the content to older pages will help your visitors understand your hierarchy and find more related content (of which they're already interested in).
* It will also help Search Engines spread page importance over multiple pages within your site; this is also known as link juice.

	= 2.6.5 - Skyscraper Technique =

* Have you found something that greatly interests you, and do you think you can write a better article than you've found?
* Go write it, in your own words and style. Don't forget to make it much longer, better and more detailed. Don't forget to add images.
* Finally, share the content, reach out to the public, and of course your public. This will increase your rankings significantly.
* This method is known as the Skyscraper Technique; it's used for and as this SEO tip, minus the images, details or length.

	= 2.6.6 - Know your Keywords =

* To know how your website is found, sign up for Google Search Console. Over a couple of days (or weeks), elegant data has been accumulated about your website.
* When you go to the Search Analytics within the Search Console, you'll see a list of queries people have used to find your website.
* The queries can be used as keywords, they are excellent starting points for new post titles and subjects. Go ahead, use them!

	= 2.7.0 - Compatible Love =

* One of the most critical aspects of SEO is being found. However, Google isn't likely to trust your website until others do. This greatly affects your website's ranking.
* Because of this, your website needs to be linked to by trusted sources. The more trustworthy a source is, the more trust your website gains at Google.
* Google needs to understand the relation between your website and another as well. If a site talks about hosting events, and your site is about one particular type of event, they are likely compatible.
* If your website sells candy, be careful not to place a link towards or on an agency website when your website is new.
* So, do not ever spread your first links across multiple websites that are completely unrelated to yours.
* Do not forget to link to other related websites, this way Google knows what your website is about. For example, Google can then distinguish Apple (technology) from apple (fruit).

	= 2.8.0 - Know your Knowledge =

* Not all SEO techniques are actively used on Google outside of the United States.
* For example, the Site Name Schema.org script might not have any effect.
* This changes over time as Google updates its Search Engine all over the world.
* Usage of experimental Schema.org scripts with The SEO Framework cause no harm to ranking.

	= 2.9.0 - Trust in layout =

* Is your website glitchy and has placeholder images, unmatched colors or weirdly contrasting borders all over the place?
* Consider going for a more modern and clean layout. Strip out what isn't necessary. A clean layout implies professionalism and increases visitors' trust.
* Even if you're just starting out with your website, remove all that could be but really isn't. Because if you leave in placeholders for the future, it implies amateurism.
* People want their truth to be confirmed or their problems to be solved. If you can't confirm or solve the layout of your website, then they won't trust you to do so for their issues.
* Simply put: It doesn't have to be perfect, it just must be done.
