/**
 * Human nature is like whirling water. If a breach is made to the east, it flows to the east; if a breach is made to the west, it flows west.
 * And just as water does not discern between east and west, so man's nature is indifferent to good or bad.
 * It is true that water will flow indifferently to east and west, but will it flow equally well up and down?
 * Human nature is disposed toward goodness, just as water tends to flow downwards.
 * There is no water but flows downwards, and no man but shows his tendency to be good.
 * Now, by striking water hard, you may splash it higher than your forehead, and by damming it, you may make it go uphill.
 * But, is that the nature of water? It is external force that causes it to do so.
 * Likewise, if a man is made to do what is not good, his nature is being similarly forced.
