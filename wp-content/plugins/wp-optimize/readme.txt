WP-Optimize is WordPress's most-installed optimization plugin. With it, you can clean up your database easily and safely, without manual queries.

== Description ==

WP-Optimize is an effective tool for automatically cleaning your WordPress database so that it runs at maximum efficiency.

= Major Features =

* Removes all unnecessary data (e.g. trashed/unapproved/spam comments, stale data) plus pingbacks, trackbacks and expired transient options
* Compact/de-fragment MySQL tables with a button-press
* Detailed control of which optimizations you wish to carry out
* Carries out automatic weekly (or otherwise) clean-ups
* Retains a set number of weeks' data during clean-ups
* Performs optimizations without the need for running manual queries
* Automatically trigger a pre-optimize backup via UpdraftPlus (https://updraftplus.com)
* Show database statistics and potential savings
* Mobile friendly and easy-to-use
* Translated into several languages
* More planned!

= WP-Optimize helps you to: =

* <strong>Make space:</strong> When you edit a post or page on your website, WordPress automatically saves the new revision to the database. If you edit things a few times (and particularly if the post is long), your database soon gets clogged up with old revisions that just sit there, taking up valuable space. WP-Optimize removes these unnecessary post revisions, freeing up valuable Megabytes of data and increasing speed and efficiency. It also cleans up your comments table, removing all the spam and un-approved comments that have built up with a single click.

* <strong>Take control:</strong> WP-Optimize reports on exactly which of your database tables have overhead and wasted space, giving you the insight, control and power to keep your website neat, fast and efficient.

* <strong>Keep it clean:</strong> Once enabled, WP-Optimize can run an automatic clean-up on a schedule, keeping a selected number of weeks' data, according to your specification. 

When you use this plugin for the first time or just updated to major version, make a backup of your database (we recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus">UpdraftPlus</a>). Though none of the queries used are dangerous, it is always the best practice to make a database backup before altering your database.

= How this could help you? =

* The tables in MySQL (the database that WordPress uses) will, over time, become inefficient as data is added, removed, moved around. Asking MySQL to optimize its tables every now and again will keep your site running as fast as possible. It won't happen by itself.

* Every-time you save a new post or pages, WordPress creates a revision of that post or page. If you edit a post 6 times you might have 5 copy of that post as revisions. This quickly adds lots of rarely-used data to your database tables, making them unnecessarily bloated, and slower to access.

* Similar to the scenario described above, there might be thousands of spam and un-approved comments in your comments table, WP-Optimize can clean and remove those in a single click.

* WP-Optimize reports which database tables have overhead and wasted spaces also it allows you to shrink and get rid of those wasted spaces.

* Automatically cleans database every week and respects the "Keeps selected number of weeks data" option.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is optimizing my database safe? =
Yes; optimizing does not involve any "tricks" or poking around in dangerous ways. It involves running routine clean-up operations using well-defined, common MySQL commands. Nevertheless, we always recommend backups, which cover every possibility; not just database malfunctions, but hackers, human errors, etc. We recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a>.

= What savings can I expect to make? =
This is a "how long is string?" sort of question. It depends completely on your site - how big it is, how many users interact on it, how long it has been running, and when you last optimised it. However, the savings and speed-ups can be substantial; it is always worth making sure that your database is optimized.

= How do I get support? =
In our support forum, here: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-optimize/

= WP-Optimize does not make large savings on my database =
This is rare; it’s probably because you’re with a shared web hosting company that doesn’t allow scripts to run an optimize command via SQL statements (SQL "OPTIMIZE" instruction). Please consult your web hosting company on this matter.

= Is the plugin tried and tested? =
Yes - WP-Optimize is WordPress's #1 most-installed optimization plugin, with over 500,000 users and a pedigree going back over 7 years.

= Does WP-Optimize support InnoDB tables? =
WP-Optimize will disable some features if it detects InnoDB tables. Optimization of the database tables on-disk is not available, but other clean up features would work.

= Can you help me restore my database? =
I'm afraid that this is not possible. Please ensure that you make a backup of your entire database before using WP-Optimize for the first time, and when you upgrade to a major new version of it. We recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a>.

= Are there any bugs in this plugin? =
The plugin is an ongoing work; that means that it is impossible to rule out unforeseen situations and bugs. So I would recommend you to test it out on your local system or make a backup of your database (just to be extra careful).

= How do I stop transient options from coming back automatically each time I clear them? =
When WordPress uses a particular transient, that specific transient is re-created automatically. So, it's normaly for ones which are in active use to gradually re-appear. The best way to keep things optimal is to clear the transient options on a scheduled basis. For example, WordPress may create 50 transient option in a week. If you schedule WP-Optimize to clear these options on a weekly basis, you’ll have far fewer building up.

= The table size shows wrong / Not optimizing  =
Please check your database for corrupted tables. That can happen, usually your web hosting company can run the repair command on the db.
