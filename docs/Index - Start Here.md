This is the repository that powers https://bowdoinorient.com/, the website for the Bowdoin Orient student newspaper.

The website is built on WordPress, with four custom WordPress components:

- [Orient Theme](Orient%20Theme.md), a WordPress theme
- [[orient-home-pages]], a WordPress plugin that provides a user interface for editing the home page,
- [[orient-taxonomies]], a WordPress plugin that registers extra post types
- [[orient-image-handling]], a WordPress plugin that registers [[Shortcodes]] that power attributed image embedding.
