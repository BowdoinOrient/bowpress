`orient-theme` is the name of the WordPress theme that powers the Bowdoin Orient website. It is a *classic theme*, not a *block theme*.

The theme's "root directory" is [here](https://github.com/BowdoinOrient/bowpress/tree/master/wp-content/themes/orient-theme): `/wp-content/themes/orient-theme`.

## Working with CSS

[By definition](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css/), every WordPress theme needs to have a file called `style.css` in the root of the theme directory. That file has a header comment that exposes some metadata so WordPress can show a preview of the theme.

Our `style.css` file is completely autogenerated. You should never edit it by hand! Instead, we write Sass, a CSS extension, and run a post-processing command to generate `style.css`.

You can find all the (hand-written) Sass files in the `scss` directory underneath the theme's root directory. `style.scss` is the main file that imports everything else.

If you want to process the Sass once:

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the theme's root directory
2. Run `npm run build`

If you want Sass to watch all the `.scss` files and re-process the file when there's a change:

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the theme's root directory
2. Run `npm run dev`

When publishing changes you made to the Sass files, make sure to add both the `.scss` files and the generated `style.css` file to your Git commit.

## Working with Javascript

The Orient theme has no Javascript bundler or post-processor. Feel free to edit `js/script.js` directly.

jQuery is available, but while most tutorials expect you to reference the jQuery global variable with a dollar sign `$`, our setup requires that you use the global variable name `jQuery` instead.
