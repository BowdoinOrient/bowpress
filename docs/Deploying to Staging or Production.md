The live site is hosted on [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/), a WordPress hosting vendor. Bowdoin IT maintains the WPEngine subscription and they give us accounts to upload source code files. To upload to WPEngine, you'll need a WPEngine SFTP username and password (if you don't have this, ask someone in IT.)

The project includes a script you can run to upload code to the staging server. In the root of the project, run the following terminal command:

```sh
npm run upload
```
